Hi, this is Elise. I am a Scientist at Sirius XM + Pandora. Before joining Pandora, I earned my Ph.D. degree in <a href="http://cnets.indiana.edu/">Complex Systems</a> from Indiana University Bloomington. My research focuses on how people create narratives to understand themselves and the world around them. My work draws methodology from natural language processing, computational linguistics, and text mining. The topics of my study includes online communities, social media, non-profit organizations, and podcasts. I am also an affiliate of the <a href="https://cns-nrt.indiana.edu/students/affiliates/index.html">NSF program of Interdisciplinary Training in Complex Networks and Systems</a>, and an alumni of the <a href="https://www.santafe.edu/">Santa Fe Institute</a>.
<br>
<br>
I study philosophy of science and philosophy of mind as a side interest, along with other things such as parkour, playing instruments, and traveling. I have an <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/145842521@N04/albums">album</a> of my personal travel photos.

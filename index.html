Hi, this is Elise. I am a Ph.D. student in the <a href="http://cnets.indiana.edu/">Center for Complex Networks and Systems Research</a>, School of Informatics and Computing, Indiana University. My track of study is Complex Systems, with minor in Computational Linguistics. My advisor is <a href="http://yongyeol.com/">Professor Yong-Yeol "YY" Ahn</a>. Previous to joining the program, I received Bachelor's degree from <a href="http://www.sysu.edu.cn/2012/en/index.htm">Sun Yat-sen University</a> in 2014, dual-majoring in Information Science and Anthropology. I am also an affiliate of the <a href="https://cns-nrt.indiana.edu/students/affiliates/index.html">NSF program of Interdisciplinary Training in Complex Networks and Systems</a>, and an alumni of the <a href="https://www.santafe.edu/">Santa Fe Institute</a>.

<br>
<br>
My main research interest is in text mining and natural language processing. I analyze text data to better understand the people who create, consume, and transmit them. The scope of our studies has included online communities, social media, and non-profit organizations. I also have a specialization in network analysis methods (Please see my Research page for more details).
<br>
<br>
More broadly, I am interested in how people (think they) understand the world. I study philosophy of science and philosophy of mind as a side interest, along with other things such as parkour, playing instruments, and traveling. I have an <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/145842521@N04/albums">album</a> of my personal travel photos.
<br>
<br>
<a href="https://blackbird07.github.io/categories/">My personal blog</a> has things about traveling, reading, science fiction, and Internet freedom. Note that only some of them are written in English.

As one of the 11 winning teams of the 2015 
<a href="https://blog.linkedin.com/2015/05/11/announcing-winners-of-the-linkedin-economic-graph-challenge">
LinkedIn Economic Graph Challenge</a>
, our team analyses the labor flow network, a large network with more than 300 million nodes, that we constructed from LinkedIn user profiles. We ran a community detection algorithm to identify hierarchical community structures from the network, and propose that the communities, which we name micro-industries, are important units that help us understand the organization of the global economy.

The project has been presented in poster form at the NetSci 2017, and orally at the CCS 2017. The poster can be viewed

Fanfictions are a special kind of cultural products of our time. This project studies the relationship between novelty and success of fanfictions in fandoms. I collected near 1 million fanfictions from a well-known fanfiction archive, and utilized language models to model the texts. Using semantic distances to define the novelty of fictions, we found that the increasing novelty of a fiction has a negative impact on its success among its readers.

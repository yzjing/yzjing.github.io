It was a lot of fun to attend the [CCS17](http://ccs17.unam.mx/) in Cancun, Mexico: cool people, warm Caribbean waters, and many interesting things happening. I also brought (and left) there the first academic poster I made, showing some results from my Fanfiction project. It may be far from a perfect poster, but I enjoyed making it; and since it likely met its end in the trash pile behind the conference center, I would like to keep a copy here in my digital archive.
